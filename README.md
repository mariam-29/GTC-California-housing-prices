# California House Price Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`GTC-HousePricePrediction.ipynb`) that predicts California house prices using the `housing.csv` dataset. It uses Linear Regression, Random Forest, and an ensemble model, with visualizations for data exploration and model evaluation.

## How to Run
- Download `housing.csv` from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices) or use Scikit-learn's `fetch_california_housing`.
- Install dependencies: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`.
- Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.
